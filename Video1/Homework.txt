# CDN (Content Delivery Network) links are URLs that point to files hosted on a distributed network of servers. CDNs are commonly used to deliver static files such as images, videos, stylesheets, and JavaScript files to users around the world, quickly and reliably.

CDN links are usually provided by third-party service providers, such as Cloudflare, Google, or Amazon. When you use a CDN link to include a file in your web page, the file is served from a server that is geographically closer to the user, reducing the latency and improving the page load time.

#crossorigin is an attribute in HTML that specifies how the browser should handle cross-origin requests for a resource. A cross-origin request is a request for a resource from a different domain, protocol, or port than the one used to serve the current web page.
